**Before:** Mr Trump called Nafta "a disaster" and warned that the TPP "is going to be worse, so we will stop it." He also pledged to correct the trade deficit with China.

**After:** Mr Trump followed through in his first few days on his pledge to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). He later said he would consider re-joining the TPP if he got a better deal.

On 30 November, after protracted negotiations, the US, Canada and Mexico signed the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement which was designed to replace Nafta, although it still requires congressional approval.

The US and China, meanwhile, became embroiled in an escalating trade battle - with both sides imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods. They agreed a 90-day truce in December, although Mr Trump has threatened to impose more tariffs if necessary.



## A border wall paid for by Mexico

**Before:** His vow to build a wall along the US-Mexican border was one of the most controversial of Mr Trump's campaign promises. Mr Trump also insisted that Mexico would pay for it.

**After:** Not one brick has been laid of the "big, beautiful wall". Mexico poured scorn on the claim that it would pay for such a barrier, and even Mr Trump appears to have dropped that idea.

Democrats are vociferously opposed to a wall, whereas some Republicans have baulked at a bill that could reach $21.5bn (Â£17bn), according to a Department of Homeland Security internal report.

In December 2018 the US government went into shutdown after Democrats resisted Mr Trump's demands for $5bn to fund the wall.

All Mr Trump has to show so far for his signature campaign pledge is a photocall of him posing alongside wall prototypes.
